        Mr. C is an 85-year-old man with history of hypertension & hyperlipidemia, but otherwise very healthy. 
        He presents to his PCP with hematuria (blood in his urine) and is ultimately found to have a large bladder mass 
        that is invading through his bladder into his left pelvic side wall. Staging workup reveals that the cancer has 
        metastasized to other areas including his bones. He is referred to a urologist, a medical oncologist, and to a 
        radiation oncologist.
