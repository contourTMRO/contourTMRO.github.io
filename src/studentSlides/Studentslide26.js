        Now it's time to make a radiation plan!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The first step is to <em>contour</em> the tumor in the planning software
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <em>Contouring</em> is the process of outlining the tumor and nearby organs at risk
        <br/>
        <br/>
        These contours are used to make a radiation plan that optimizes dose to target volume while minimizing dose to normal tissue
