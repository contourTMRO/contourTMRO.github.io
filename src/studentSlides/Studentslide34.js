        When we evaluate a palliative radiation treatment plan, the most important things to check are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Does the beam arrangement make sense?</li>
        <li>
          Is the PTV adequately covered?
          <ul>
            <li><em>Dose distribution</em></li>
            <li><em>Target coverage</em></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="purple_box">
        We already came up with a beam arrangement that makes the most sense.
