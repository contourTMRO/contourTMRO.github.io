           Based on physical exam and measurements obtained on patient's MRI, we opt to use a 6 cm tandem angled at 60 degrees, and 3 cm ring diameter. The patient arrives for her first fraction and is placed under conscious sedation for applicator insertion. A CT scan is acquired with applicator in place.

           <p>
           On a representative sagittal section of the patient's simulation CT scan, we see that the tandem is relatively centered and adequately placed within the uterus. We also see that the ring is flush against the cervix with no air gaps.
