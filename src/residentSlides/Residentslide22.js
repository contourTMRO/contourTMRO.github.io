        The standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer is chemoRT
        followed by intracavitary or interstitial brachytherapy boost. She is
        simulated and planned for radiation. An intensity modulated radiotherapy
        (IMRT) plan is made for 45 Gy in 25 Fx to the pelvis. She begins
        external radiation and tolerates treatment with side effects of grade 2
        diarrhea and grade 1 urinary frequency. She receives concurrent
        radiosensitizing chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.
