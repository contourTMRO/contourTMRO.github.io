          With the help of our physicists, we are able to develop a treatment
          plan to deliver adequate dose to the GTV andÂ HR CTV in 5 fractions,
          while sparing OAR. When planning, we prioritize organ constraints over
          target coverage to limit toxicity. Ms. E tolerates her first fraction
          without any issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          She returns for each of her subsequent fractions. Each time, we place
          the applicator, obtain simulation CT and day of treatment T2-weighted
          MRI, and we create a plan tailored based on her imaging. Each time,
          the treatment is well-tolerated.

          We schedule one month follow-up, at which time, we plan to prescribe a
          vaginal dilator to mitigate risk of vaginal stenosis.
